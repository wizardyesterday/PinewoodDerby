This is just some code I wrote to avoid arguments as to who was the winner
of pinewood derby races.  A coworker gave me an 8051 controller, so I built
up a light frame (infrared emitters and sensors) that would be "wrapped
around the race track) to be used in races.

I have some sample output so that one can get an idea of what the parents
would see at the end of a race.

Enjoy!
